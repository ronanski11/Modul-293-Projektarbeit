# Modul-293-Projektarbeit

Welcome to the Modul-293-Projektarbeit repository. This project is a collection of various web development files including SCSS, Less, HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. The project is currently at version 3.0.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:

- SCSS files: These are used for styling the web pages. SCSS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- Less files: Less is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into CSS and run on the client side or server side.
- HTML files: These are the backbone of the web project. The HTML folder contains four files: Homepage.html, Klub.html, Kontakt.html, and Mitglied.html. Each of these files represents a different page of the web project.
- CSS files: The CSS folder contains a single file, style.css, which is likely used to style all the HTML pages in the project.
- JavaScript files: These are used to make the web pages interactive.
